                    On July 24, 2024, Apple launched a public beta of Apple Maps on the web, allowing global users to
                    access Maps directly from their browsers. The web version provides driving and walking directions,
                    place information, photos, hours, ratings, reviews, food ordering from place cards, and curated
                    Guides for exploring cities. Additional features, like Look Around, will be added soon. Developers
                    using MapKit JS can link to Maps on the web for detailed place information and directions. Currently
                    available in English, it supports Safari and Chrome on Mac and iPad, and Chrome and Edge on Windows
                    PCs, with plans to expand language, browser, and platform support over time. Availability varies by
                    region.

                <h6 class="text-black-50 text-lg-start">July 26, 2024</h6>
                <p class="text-lg-start text-md-center text-sm-center text-dark fs-6">
                    A new ad for the Pixel 9 has leaked, showcasing a feature called "Add Me," which ensures no one is
                    left out of group photos. In the ad, a person uses the Pixel 9 to take a photo of friends, then
                    swaps places with them to get her own picture. The Pixel 9’s display shows ghostly images of the
                    friends beside her, and when the photo is taken, she appears in it as if she were always there. This
                    feature stitches two images with the same background together.
                    Other leaked features include Google’s Gemini assistant and "Pixel Screenshots," which uses AI to
                    search screenshots, and an upgraded Magic Editor that may allow background replacement based on
                    prompts. "Add Me" follows Google's trend of tools that blend reality, such as the Magic Eraser and
                    Best Take, which modify images to enhance photo quality. The Pixel 9 is set to debut on August 13th.

                    and fight fuel emissions</h1>
                <h6 class="text-black-50 text-lg-start">Jul 29, 2024</h6>
                <p class="text-lg-start text-md-center text-sm-center text-dark fs-6">
                    At the start of 2020, a Google Research team was tasked with exploring ideas to accelerate climate
                    mitigation. One evening, Dotan Emanuel, a software engineer on the team, discussed these ideas with
                    his family, leading his wife to suggest addressing traffic light inefficiencies. This idea sparked
                    the development of Project Green Light, which uses AI and Google Maps data to optimize traffic light
                    timings, reducing stop-and-go traffic and emissions.
                    The initiative leverages over a decade of Google Maps driving trends to create an AI model that
                    recommends adjustments to traffic light timings. These recommendations, which cities can implement
                    quickly without needing new hardware or software, aim to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions.
                    Since its first pilot in 2021, Project Green Light has expanded to over 70 intersections across
                    cities worldwide, including Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Bengaluru, and Boston. The project has shown
                    potential to reduce stops by up to 30% and emissions at intersections by up to 10%, benefiting up to
                    30 million car rides monthly.
                    The team plans to scale the project to hundreds of cities and thousands of intersections in the
                    coming years, aiming to enhance the driving experience and contribute to climate mitigation.
                    “You know when you drive through a sequence of five green lights, and it feels like your lucky day?”
                    Dotan says. “We want to make that feeling more common to more people around the world.”

                    Dinosaur Polo Club, the indie studio behind Mini Metro and Mini Motorways, has openly revealed the
                    cancellation of their project, codenamed Magic School. The game, which aimed to expand the studio's
                    scope, was abandoned due to the need for a much larger team. Despite this, the studio shared footage
                    and concept images, highlighting the team's impressive work. CEO Amie Wolken stated there was no
                    path forward for Magic School, but all team members will transition to new projects within the Mini
                    series. This transparency is notable in the typically secretive game industry, and the studio
                    chooses to celebrate the lessons learned and the team's efforts.

                    Arc'teryx has teamed up with Skip, a Google X Labs spinoff, to create the MO/GO pants, exoskeleton
                    suits designed to enhance hiking experiences. These powered pants feature lightweight electric
                    motors at the knees that boost leg strength uphill and absorb impact downhill. Weighing around seven
                    pounds with a three-hour rechargeable battery, the MO/GO pants use carbon fiber braces and are
                    integrated into Arc'teryx Gamma hiking pants for easy wear.
                    Marketed as a mobility device rather than a medical one, the pants can make the wearer feel up to 30
                    pounds lighter by adjusting assistance in real time based on gait and leg movements. Users can
                    control the level of assistance with a button. Despite not being discreet, the MO/GO pants aim to
                    make challenging hikes more accessible. They are priced at $5,000, with a preorder discount bringing
                    the cost to $4,500 and an expected release in late 2025.
                    Fast Company reported that the exoskeleton takes some time to adjust to. Skip and Arc'teryx also
                    offer eight-hour rentals for $80 on select trails in the Western US and Canada for those wanting to
                    test the pants first.

                    devices</h1>
                <h6 class="text-black-50 text-lg-start">July 30, 2024</h6>
                <p class="text-lg-start text-md-center text-sm-center text-dark fs-6">
                    Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 chip, targeting 5G accessibility for 2.8 billion
                    users in price-sensitive markets like India and Latin America. Manufacturers have struggled to
                    attract feature phone buyers in India due to a lack of 5G models under $100. The entry-level
                    segment in India declined by 14% year-on-year, while the overall market grew 11%, dominated by
                    the $200-$400 segment. Qualcomm aims to address this gap with the 4s Gen 2 chip, which Xiaomi
                    will use in its first device in India later this year.
                    The Snapdragon 4s Gen 2, a cost-effective version of the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2, is built on 4nm
                    technology with an octa-core Kryo CPU. It supports standalone 5G deployment, suitable for
                    markets like India where Jio offers standalone 5G networks. However, it lacks support for
                    non-standalone 5G, which is common in other regions.
                    IDC's Kiranjeet Kaur notes that while India's push for low-cost 5G phones is strong, global
                    momentum is slower. Qualcomm's cost-cutting measures for the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 aim to support
                    affordable 5G phones in emerging markets, potentially driving competition and momentum in the
                    lower price segment.
